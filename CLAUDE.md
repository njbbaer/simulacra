# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Guidelines

- Run all python commands using `uv` (ex. `uv run pytest`).
- Manage dependencies with `uv`.
- Format code according to Black and Flake8 conventions.
- Group public methods first, followed by private methods.
- Prefix private methods and variables with an underscore.
